5. You will then be prompted to enter the grid size. (Value between 0.01 and 0)
6. You will also need to enter a crime threshold between 0 and 100.
7. Next, you will need to enter 4 values, the x and y coordinates of your starting point, followed by the x and y coordinate of your end destination.
8. Areas in red, represent grids containing a higher crime rate then your input threshold, while blue grids represent areas with a lower number of crime.
9. The destination is represented as a black point, the starting point is represented as a green dot, and if an optimal path is found, it is represented as green lines.
